The project consists of a website where sellers can create auctions for newly released games. The buyer with the highest bid on the auction gets exclusive ownership of the game for an entire week. This can for example be used by content creators as they can be the first to play a game and therefore increase their social media views. After the auction period is over, the game is still available for anyone to order at its regular price. The website has its own specialized currency system that is used to buy and sell games.


The website lists games from different sellers and includes their descriptions and requirements. Buyers can write game reviews and comments. They can also report any violating seller.

The website also allows Administers to view statistics and reports for the performance of the website. Moderators can also approve games, view statistics, and penalize violations.
